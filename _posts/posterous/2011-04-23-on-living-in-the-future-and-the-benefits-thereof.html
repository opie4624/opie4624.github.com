<p></p><p>Tonight, I connected to the internet, over my Verizon MiFi&#39;s 3G connection. I did this from a little over a mile away.</p> <p>In my quest for inexpensive internet, I am establishing an 802.11a link with my office from my apartment. The distance for this link is around 1.1 miles. Tonight, with very little actual aiming and signal optimization, I was able to get around 45 Mbit of performance out of the link. The hardware I&#39;m using is rated at 300Mbit over  5 miles, so I&#39;m sure with a little bit of work, I can get that speed up to a limit where the bottle neck becomes the wires in my apartment.</p> <p>Here&#39;s to living in the future!<br /></p>
